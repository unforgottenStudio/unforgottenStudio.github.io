<P CLASS="cjk" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>   </FONT><FONT SIZE=3> Three years ago, I wrote about how smartwatches and smart glasses could complement each other. The idea was straightforward: let the watch sync its display with the glasses. You wouldn’t need to glance down anymore—lift your wrist, and the time appears right in front of you. Notifications? They'd just pop up instantly in your field of view. The watch would only come into play when you needed deeper interaction.</FONT><SPAN LANG="en-US"></SPAN><FONT SIZE=3></FONT></P>

<P CLASS="cjk" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>Fast forward to today. Meta’s Ray-Ban Display glasses and the new Neural Band are making that concept feel very real. If the Neural Band can double as a “watch strap,” there’s little reason for a smartwatch to even exist. The display is already on your glasses, and the Neural Band takes care of the input. Why keep a screen on your wrist when you no longer need to look down?</FONT><SPAN LANG="en-US"></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="cjk" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>  Which raises the big question: is the smartwatch era already winding down? With displays shifting to glasses and sensing packed into bands, the smartwatch risks becoming redundant. It was once the future of wearables; now it might just be a stepping stone. </FONT><SPAN LANG="en-US"></P>

<P CLASS="cjk" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3> That said, the watch as a form factor carries its own unique significance. Watches—whether mechanical or digital—have always been more than tools; they are symbols of style, status, and even personal identity. A smartwatch on the wrist still serves as an always-visible, discreet device—something glasses may not fully replace, especially in social or professional settings where subtlety matters.  </FONT><SPAN LANG="en-US"></P>
<P CLASS="cjk" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>

<P CLASS="cjk" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3>So while Meta's vision suggests a future where the smartwatch is technically unnecessary, it may not disappear altogether. Instead, we might see a redefinition: the smartwatch evolving into a niche product for fashion, lifestyle, and health-conscious users, while the mainstream of human–computer interaction shifts toward glasses and neural interfaces. </FONT><SPAN LANG="en-US"></P>

<P CLASS="cjk" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=3> The real question isn't whether the smartwatch survives, but what it becomes in a world where the interface lives on your face.</FONT><SPAN LANG="en-US"></P>
